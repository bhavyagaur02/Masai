Tic Tac Toe
Overview: 
This project is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game. It is designed to be played by two players on the same device. The game is a fun, interactive way to demonstrate logic, user interface creation, and game flow. 
Language: Python
Features
Two-player Mode: Play against a friend on the same device.
Simple User Interface: Click-based input system to mark the game board.
Win Detection: The game checks for horizontal, vertical, or diagonal wins.
Draw Detection: The game detects if all spaces are filled without a winner.
How to Play
Player 1 (X) starts by clicking on an empty space.
Player 2 (O) takes their turn by clicking on any remaining empty space.
The game checks for a winner after each move. The first player to align three markers (X or O) wins the game.
If no one wins and the board is filled, the game ends in a draw.
